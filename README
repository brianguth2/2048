Java Related Questions:

5. static means that the method is available for the whole class. You do not
    need to create an instance for it.
    
    public class Foo(){
        public static void mystery(){
        //blah
        }
    }
    you can call Foo.mystery rather than
    Foo this =  new Foo();
    this.mystery

6. In your ShapeDrawer class, you create an object that is of the form
    ShapeDrawer. So whenever you want to create one, reference it as that
    also in this way:
    ShapeDrawer circle = new ShapeDrawer();
    This way, you are referencing your variable "circle" as an object from
    the type of your class ShapeDrawer.
    Next, since it is an object of your class and given that your class has
    the method drawRedCircle(), this means that your ShapeDrawer object
    (named "circle") can use this method that you created to draw a red
    circle!
